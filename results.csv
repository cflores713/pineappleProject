1564e3996f7e1223,"== Kashoo marked for deletion? == 

 Hello Armburst, 

 I am writing to inquire about specific reasons why the company I have written an article about has been nominated for quick deletion. The company called Kashoo is a fairly new but very relevant for a number of reasons. One of them being that they have created an open source project at their core. This project uses reflection and dependency injection and is way out on the front of what is happening in Java development. They are the very first (and only) Facelets-like implementation for GWT. I tried to point this out in the article but maybe it was not seen as significant because there is a lack of understanding about software development? 

 As a caveat, I run my own company (beloud.ca) and use this product. I chose to write an article about them on Wikipedia after noting that they were not included in the comparison of accounting software (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_accounting_software). In order to have them listed in this list I was told that I needed to make an article. I followed the guidelines the best I could and had my first attempts deleted immediately. I created this article on the discussion page (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Articles_for_creation/Kashoo) so that I may have a discussion about how to improve the article in order to get it included. I have not received comments or discussion and just default note quick deletion. 

 I have outlined the open source component that makes this company relevant (not to mention they are an emerging market leader in a newly defined area of SaaS). And I have also linked to articles from non-trivial sources (Google, Yahoo and Business Week). What is wrong with my approach? These guys have been so great to me I really think they should be included in the comparison of accounting software. I would also like to note that after auditing the other companies included in this list, comparing accounting software, there are at the very least 26 companies that fall short of even the simplest criteria you lay fourth - how is it that they are included? 

 I would really appreciate any advice or help you could give to get this article listed. 

 Thanks very much for taking the time. 

 Best regards, 

 Christopher.

 Who opposes legalizing Marijuana and why  

 There are many types of people who oppose legalizing Marijuana for a variety of reasons. Many of these groups have some very strange reasons and selfish interests. Many are just ignorant of the facts. Here's some of the opposition:  

 The Uninformed - People who believe the misinformation that Pot is harmful to society. 

 The Government - Pot has been illegal for so long that no politicians have the political courage to tell the truth about Pot. The ones that do tell the truth are defeated by their opponents that paint them as a druggie. Many of these anti-drug politicians are funded by the Alcohol lobby.  

 Religion - Anything fun is sin and of the Devil. Churches might lose members as people figure out that God can't be that stupid.  

 Moralizers - The morally superior who enjoy looking down their noses at the less fortunate and get a sadistic thrill in putting people in jail.  

 People who do no Drugs - These people who don't drink, don't smoke, in some cases don't even drink coffee. They just don't understand why anyone would want to smoke anything or do any drug. From their perspective the world would be better off if no one did anything.  

 The Alcohol Lobby - Legalizing Pot would seriously cut into the sales of Beer. Pot would become the recreational drug of choice because it is safer than Beer.  

 The Tobacco Lobby - Pot has the ability in some people to help them break the addiction of nicotine. Pot smoking could actually reduce the number of tobacco addicts.  

 
 Law Enforcement - There are a lot of people who make a living fighting Pot who would have to go get a real job if Pot were legalized. Police departments get a lot of funding to fight Marijuana and those funds could be returned to the taxpayer if Pot were made legal. Cops would have to chase robbers, rapists, and murderers.  

 Government Agencies - Using unconstitutional civil forfeiture laws the government has been able to use the presence of Pot to steal billions of dollars of private property from the People. Drug laws have been an excuse to circumvent our constitutional right and justify wire tap laws, the erosion of protection from illegal searches, key recovery encryption, and domestic spying. If you take a politically unpopular position like this one I'm taking now, the government can plant drugs on you and put you away.  

 Pot Dealers - If Pot were legalized then people making money off of selling Pot illegally would be out of business. Pot prices would drop to $10 a bale. Crime relating to illegal Pot money would vanish.  

 Wood Industry - Hemp would become the primary source of fiber for paper products as well as a new source for building materials. We wouldn't have to cut down every big tree in the world.  

 Private Prisons - If Pot were legalized the private prison industry would be hurt. They would no longer jail Pot smokers. It could free up space for violent criminals.  

 Trial Lawyers - Normal people caught with a joint spend billions each year on lawyers to get them off of criminal charges after getting caught with a joint. Lawyers get rich off of the Marijuana laws. If Marijuana were legal this money could be spent sending your kids to college.  

 Mental Hospitals - There's a big industry treating people for problems they don't have. If you have insurance, you're crazy until the insurance coverage runs out. If you smoke Pot then you have mental problems. If Pot were legal some of these people would have to get real jobs. We should start treating people who are addicted to 12 step programs.  

 Republicans - Pot helps you see reality the way it really is. It's harder to con a Pot smoker on political issues. Once you get stoned it's harder to want to hate Liberals, Queers, Blacks, Pregnant Teens, Draft Dodgers, President Clinton, Feminists, Lesbians, Pot Smokers, and other people the Republicans want you to hate. When you're stoned it's harder to like Newt Gingrich, John Ashcroft, the KKK, the Christian Coalition, Jerry Falwell, Pat Buchanan, Reverend Sun Myung Moon, People who beat Gay's to Death, People who blow up Abortion Clinics, and the morally superior in general.  

 Political Cowards - Politicians like to pose with police as somebody who is """"against drugs"""" promising to lock up all the pot smokers and throw away the key. These people need an artificial issue to be against so they don't have to face real issues like how to protect the public from crooked lawyers and crooked judges. Political cowards cross all party lines when it comes to pot and includes President Clinton.  

 Others - These groups could also be hurt by legalizing Pot. Car body shops would get less alcohol related wrecks to",-0.10000000149011612,19.5,None

There is no scientific discussion as far as I know about why this should matter, but there is also no scientific discussion on why per capita rating is better or more relevant than by nation. This is not so much a scientific debate as one of interpreting statistics, and as such there is no 'right' way to analyze the numbers we see on emissions. Being as both analysis have political consequences, the best way to maintain neutrality is to represent both points of view. Sort of like how when the US government formed there was disagreement on how states would be represented in Congress, resulting in both the Senate (by state) and the House (by population): neither solution could have stood on its own. ~ | """,-0.10000000149011612,1.899999976158142,None

 == What is Around the World? == 

 It's a collaboration using advanced wiki-tools.  It is sponsored jointly by WikiProject Lists of basic topics and WikiProject Geography. 

 Using these advanced tools, we are building a profile for every country of the world.  These drafts are listed at Wikipedia:WikiProject Lists of basic topics. 

 These profiles summarize essential information on each country.  They are """"topic outlines"""", but at the same time they are so much more, because Wikipedia is a hypertextual environment.  Most of the topics presented are linkified, which turns these pages into a sort of site map to material about each country on Wikipedia. 

 The profiles share a standard format.  So rather than tediously working on a single country to complete it, each participant works on all 200+ political entities, completing a single data item or detail across all of the pages.  For this they use advanced tools like WP:AWB, Linky, etc.  It goes fast, and since others are doing this at the same time, it  makes """"the World"""" (the set of country profiles) feel like a beehive, and the participants are its bees.  )  The energy is contagious. 

 And since you are moving from country to country, the tasks make it feel like you are traveling all around the world, and you get to learn a little about every country as you do so.  This approach also allows for greater efficiency, because by the time you've done 30 or so of a particular item, you've figured out how to finish it faster and more effectively (such as where to find the data or how to make adjustments), and this specialization speeds up development - but more importantly it reduces errors. 

 The tasks are varied, which adds even more variety to the project.  Some tasks are look-ups-and-fill-ins, some are copy and paste, some are image hunts, some are maintenance adjustments, some are link fixing, some are blue-linking (creating an underlying redirect so a link turns blue), some are fact checking, etc. 

 Standing by to help are co-coordinators, who can lend a helping hand to participants, provide instruction and tips on how to use the tools, and help them find what they are looking for.  Co-coordinators also use advanced tools to inspect the work of participants, and touch it up as needed, or if a task was done wrong throughout, point this out to the participant so he or she can make the necessary corrections. 

 Co-coordinators are working on the set of pages right now, to familiarize themselves with """"the World"""" so they can help more effectively by the time the main event starts.  But there's still lots of preparation left to be done, and we are looking for editors experienced in advanced wikitools who would like to become co-coordinators.
